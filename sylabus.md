## Sylabus for Advanced Topics in CS:
#### Topics:
* Advanced data structures
* Data science
* Neural networks

#### CS Tech:
* `Node.js` (definitely)
* `React` (definitely)
* `Chrome Extensions` (maybe)
* `Sass` (maybe)

#### Project:
The project I am working on is an app which uses html5 drag and drop to allow for the editing of debate documents.
It may include a chrome extension similar to Zotero to add articles to a file.
It will save the formatting / tags in each file, and the text and metadata in a database file.
Cards will be referenced by their urls or possibly a hash of their urls.

#### Topics:
Data structures will be useful in this because I donâ€™t know how I will store the data from the articles, and keep them searchable.
