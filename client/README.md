#### Compared to Verbatim

1. ###### Space efficient
    - Only save one copy of a card in the dropbox, and have all your files contain a reference to it, compared to having 100 copies of wilderson.
    - Save cards with file if its on a flashdrive
2. ###### Drag and drop
    - Drag and drop cards from a reaserch pane with a search bar
    - Drag and drop sections from one doc to another
    - Ensures no accidental changes are made to cards
3. ###### A Better file format
    - More Subheadings (not limited to pockets blocks and hats)
      - Simply click and hold on the black circle where you want to insert a heading
    - No way to accidentally change card text
    - Can be easily exported to a .html file which can be opened on virtualy anything (computer, phone, watch, kindle).
    - Space efficiency
4. ###### Cross-platform
    - Works exactly the same on windows, Mac, and Linux
    - Support for ChromeOS later on in development
5. ###### Native \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Support
    - Better wiki Support
      - One click upload, no wierd formatting.
    - Tabroom support that integrates with the wiki
6. ###### Improved in-round file organization
    - Send to speech includes an option to create a file name based off the current speech
    - More Reliable V-Tub
